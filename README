Security Exchange Notifier
__________________________
it
This project is a Mac OSX status bar application for displaying information regarding your (or other person) account in IT Security (Part of SecurityExchange).

The application currently shows:
- Reputation (day/week/month/quarter/year/overall)
- Badge count.
- Latest reputation changes.
- Recent questions in the site.

Requirements:
- Mac OSX 10.8.

The application is based on StackExchange API 2.0, (docs may be found at http://api.stackexchange.com/).

This is a fork of the very fine SONotifier by Binyamin Sharet, made originally for StackOverflow. I only changed it to work with Security Exchange, by changing some icons and changing some definitions.
